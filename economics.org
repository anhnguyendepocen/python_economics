#+Title: Doing economics with python
#+Author: Jan Boone


* Introduction

This is the notebook to accompany the course Applied Economic Analysis at Tilburg University. The idea is to bring economic concepts "alive" by programming them in python. The choice of topics is mainly based on cite:tirole_2017.

* Python packages that we will be using

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import pymc3 as pm
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from scipy import stats, optimize

plt.style.use('seaborn')

* Why do we love the market?

Many (but not all) economists love the market as an organizing institution. This affection for markets is traced back by some to Adam Smith and his "invisible hand". Others basically distrust other organizing institutions like a government. They will point to the fall of communism in the former soviet union.

To understand the advantages of the market, let us consider a very
simple economy. We focus on one type of product and there is an
exogenous endowment of this product (supply) equal to
~number_of_goods~. Further there are ~number_of_agents~ agents who
have a valuation for this good which is randomly drawn from a normal
distribution. An agent can at max. consume one unit of the product and her utility is then given by her valuation. The value of consuming zero units and the additional value of consuming more than one unit equal 0.

The vector ~valuations~ contains for each agent her valuation and we sort this vector such that the first agent has the highest valuation.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
number_of_agents = 1000
number_of_goods = 100

valuations = sorted(pm.Normal.dist(100,20).random(size=number_of_agents),reverse = True)
#+END_SRC

# Out[16]:
:END:

**Question** What is the economic name for the following expression? To answer this question, you need to understand both how indexing works in python and which economic concept is captured by this expression.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
print("{0:.2f}".format(valuations[number_of_goods]))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[21]:
# output
: 123.48
: 
:END:

Suppose that we have an omniscient social planner who knows the valuation of every agent in the economy. This planner aims to maximize the (unweighted) sum of agents' utilities.

**Question** Calculate the total welfare that this planner can achieve. Denote this value ~max_welfare~.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :no export
max_welfare = np.sum(valuations[:number_of_goods])
print("{0:.2f}".format(max_welfare))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[23]:
# output
: 13228.83
: 
:END:

** market outcome

Now we compare the maximum welfare that a planner can achieve with the market outcome.

**Question** Define a function ~demand(p,valuations)~ which has as arguments a price $p$ and a vector of agents' valuations. This function returns the number of agents who are willing to buy the product at price $p$.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :no export
def demand(p,valuations):
    return sum(valuations>p)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[31]:
:END:

**Question** Plot supply and the function ~demand~ against price, where we maintain the economic convention of having quantity on the horizontal axis and price on the vertical axis.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :no export
range_p = np.arange(60,150)

plt.plot([demand(p,valuations) for p in range_p],range_p, label = "demand")
plt.plot([number_of_goods for p in range_p],range_p, label="supply")
plt.legend()
plt.xlabel("$Q$")
plt.ylabel("$P$")
plt.show()
#+END_SRC

:END:

In order to calculate the equilibrium price, we define a function ~excess_demand~. 

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
def excess_demand(p,valuations,number_of_goods):
    return demand(p,valuations)-number_of_goods
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[33]:
:END:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
price = optimize.fsolve(lambda x: excess_demand(x,valuations,number_of_goods),120)
print(price)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[34]:
# output
: [123.48580396]

:END:


1. calculate welfare
2. compare to max. welfare from planner


Now we give ~number_of_goods~ agents one unit of the good. They become suppliers.





** why do others not love the market?

*** income distribution

define vector income; you can only buy at price $p$ if valuation and income exceed $p$

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
incomes = pm.Normal.dist(100,20).random(size=number_of_agents)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[26]:
:END:



#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
def afford(p,incomes):
    return incomes>p

def wtp(p,valuations):
    return valuations>p

def demand_2(p,valuations,incomes):
    return np.sum(afford(p,incomes)*wtp(p,valuations))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[27]:
:END:


#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
def excess_demand_2(p,valuations,incomes,number_of_goods):
    return demand_2(p,valuations,incomes)-number_of_goods
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[28]:
:END:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
price_2 = optimize.fsolve(lambda x: excess_demand_2(x,valuations,incomes,number_of_goods),120)
print(price_2)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[35]:
# output
: [109.42355133]
: 
:END:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
welfare_2 = np.sum(afford(price_2,incomes)*wtp(price_2,valuations)*valuations)
print(welfare_2)
print(max_welfare)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[39]:
# output

**Question** Show that as income inequality increases, the welfare generated by the market tends to fall.

* Asymmetric information

Explain what the python does in the following code cell:

v_std = np.arange(0,200,1)
v_returns = [pm.Normal.dist(-10,std).random(size=1000) for std in v_std]
plt.scatter([np.std(vx) for vx in v_returns],[profit(vx) for vx in v_returns])
plt.show()
